Webpack is a module bundler. Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser. 
By packing multiple js modules into single file, we reduce the no of network requests, which 
in turn reduces the page load time.

installing webpack:
npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli

webpack looks for webpack.config.js in root project directory for its configuration.

//sample minimal webpack.config.js
const path = require('path');
const CleanPlugin = require('clean-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
  // can set mode to "production" as well
  // when mode is development, script files are served from memory
  mode: 'development',
  entry: './src/app.js',
  output: {
    // can set to filename: '[contenthash].js', to have 
    // unique file names for each build for production
    filename: 'app.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'assets', 'scripts'),
    //need to specify below path to correctly load dynamically loaded module pack js file
    publicPath: 'assets/scripts/'
  },
  //specifies source mapping for easier debugging
  devtool: 'cheap-module-eval-source-map',
  //specify location to host for webpack-dev-server
  //specifies to the dev server where root html file can be found, ./ is the default
  // devServer: {
  //   contentBase: './'
  // }
  plugins: [
    new CleanPlugin.CleanWebpackPlugin()
  ]
};

//can also specify multilple entry points in the above module.exports
entry: {
    welcome: './src/welcome-page/welcome.js',
    about: './src/about-page/about.js',
    // etc.
}

//specify "build": "webpack" in package.json to build with webpack
//specify "build:dev": "webpack-dev-server" in package for live reload on build using webpack-dev-server

Run the below build command to generate bundled optimized script
npm run build

install below server package to live reload on code changes
npm install --save-dev webpack-dev-server

lauch live reloading server for the configurations given above
npm run build:dev

build project for production for the configurations give above
//note: you should have webpack.config.prod.js file with same contents as webpack.config.js
//except that mode: 'development' , devtool: 'cheap-source-map' , filename: '[contenthash].js'
//'cheap source map' tells to generated highly optimized code, but can only debugged to certain level.
npm run build:prod

install plugin to clean webpack output directory before running build
npm install --save-dev clean-webpack-plugin

also can use html-loader css-loader and style-loader to pack html and css files
